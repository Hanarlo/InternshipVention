# Welcome to the "Vention Internship" repository! ðŸŽ‰

### About this Repo:
This repository contains the results of my internship at Vention. During the internship, I explored various development tools such as Selenium, Jenkins, Allure Report, Selenide, RestAssured, and many others.

### Repository Structure:
Each branch corresponds to some topic being studied, but the most interesting branch is the "final-project" branch. The "Final_Project" branch showcases my final project. It's a framework for testing the "Testiny" website for various defects.

Thank you for your attention, and happy exploring! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
